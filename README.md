# ux-principles

* the good side: the development process is easier, hosting app is cheaper, deploy is easy, getting to millions of pepole 
* the bad side- competition, perfect application is not enough.
* good ux can designate your app
* ux vs ui
 * build screen for 'visa-kal' call center that reduce the time to allocate billings
 * screen with all the relvant ui elements
 * story on the guy that got the bill, trafic jam, call to call center
 * `you are not the user`
* ux definition: `the process of designing a digital interface that leads to effective meeting points`
* stove example

* eyes forces
* carusel example- devs, designers, product, qa look at the screen and say -i'ts nice/not - irrelevant - we need to find how the user use our app.
* nielsen quote "most pepole just want to get in, get it and get out"
* 1-2-4 (youtube, facebook)
* F pattern
* golden ration
* 1/1 - never use it
* side menu - connet to top or connect to right
* grid items - space top or space side

* wireframes, prototype
* personas
* target audience analycies
 * interviews
 * focus groups
 * observations
 * questionnaries
 * bi analysis
 * analytics
 * eye/mouse tracking (heatmaps)
* user journey
* storyboards (airbnb)
* mood base graphs (wix?)

* define (decide how we’d like the user to scan the screen’s content)
* desing (place elements in a correct order and lead them to scan like we’d like them to)
* test (watch users use the screen to make sure they scan correctly)
